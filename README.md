# Photo to Haiku

This project aims to combine the power of smartphone photography and natural language processing to generate haikus based on the content of an image. By leveraging computer vision algorithms, the photo is analyzed to identify key elements, such as objects, colors, and emotions. These elements are then used as inspiration to generate a traditional Japanese haiku, a three-line poem consisting of 17 syllables.

## How it Works

1. Take a photo using your smartphone camera.
2. The image is processed using computer vision techniques to extract relevant features.
3. Natural language processing algorithms generate a haiku based on the identified features.
4. The generated haiku is displayed on the screen, providing a unique artistic interpretation of the image.

## Getting Started

3. Run the application and grant necessary permissions for accessing the camera.
4. Take a photo and wait for the haiku to be generated.
5. Share your haiku with friends and enjoy the creative experience!
